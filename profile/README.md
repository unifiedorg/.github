# Hey there, welcome to Unified! ðŸ‘‹
We are a small team, focused on **making the internet better, through tools, software, etc.**
Contributing would be helpful, so if you have free some on your hands and want to help us, contribute!

# Starting point
Our tools will always be **free to use** (maybe with donations and pricing tiers in the future, but we will make sure
to keep the pricing low!), and most of our projects will also be **open source**.

Currently probably our best projects are **Verdant (advanced discord bot, beta, closed source)**, **[Zinc](https://unifiedorg.github.io/zinc/) (scripting language)** and **[Lithium](https://github.com/unifiedorg/lithium) (PHP framework)** with more on the way!

# Contributing
There are two ways you can contribute to us,
- Contributing to our open source repo(s).
- Donating to us to keep us afloat.

## Contributing to our open source repo(s)
Contributing guidlines: [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/unifiedorg/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

The guidelines should be the same for every project, unless stated otherwise. (e.g. **Please read the CONTRIBUTING.md as it differs from the standard guidelines**)
